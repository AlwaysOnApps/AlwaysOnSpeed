ALWAYS-ON SPEED: PRIVACY POLICY
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Always-On Speed (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Always-On Apps (formerly Tiny Apps). The Application is a speedometer app for Wear OS smartwatches.

What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
The Application uses your geolocation data to show you information about your speed and bearing (direction of movement). It does not store your geolocation or any other personal data and does not connect to the Internet.

Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?
The Application uses GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to calculate your speed and direction of movement. We will not share your current location with other users or partners. If you do not want us to use your location for the purposes set forth above, uninstall the Application from your device. The Application cannot function without GPS.

Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?
No.

What are my opt-out rights?
You can opt-out when you first launch the Application. You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device (smartwatch or smartphone) or via the mobile application marketplace.

Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information
We do not retain User Provided data.

Children
We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

Security
The app is safe to use as it never connects to the Internet or passes information to other apps.

Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here and informing you via email or text message. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. The history of changes will be provided on this page. This is the first version of the Privacy Policy.

Your Consent
By using the Application, you consent to offline processing of your data as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing” means using geolocation data to show you information about your speed and bearing. “Offline” means that this information will never leave your smartwatch.
